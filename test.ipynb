More work is needed to investigate whether there is a causal relationship between the disappearance of attractive em ployment opportunities for workers and the retrenchment of civic life in local communities, and whether this causal effect works through the mechanisms highlighted by our framework. The evidence presented in, among others, Wilson (1996), Black, McKinnish, and Sanders (2005), and Autor, Dorn, and Hanson (2019) suggests that this is plausible, but the exact causal mech- anisms have yet to be studied empirically. For instance, it is possible that variables found to be correlated with social mobility, education, health, and other socioeconomic outcomes in these literatures may be proxying for labor market rents or how binding the outside options of differ- ent demographic groups are. Our results therefore push for empirical models where the causal effects of these variables are carefully controlled for. They also suggest new empirical tests, for example exploring whether exogenous declines in wages in an areaholding constant other aspects of\",\"relative_path\":\"Employment and Community - Socioeconomic Cooperation and Its Breakdown.pdf\",\"category\":\"Document\"},{\"chunk\":\"However, further increases in M raise total welfare, as this benefits managers and has no effect on workers.Proposition @2 shows that improving outside options shifts the equilibrium employment regime from soft or tough-but-fair to tough (in addition to reducing payoffs within each type of equilibrium). The intuition is that improving outside options reduces community benefits, which in turn makes it more difficult to dissuade managers from adopting the tough regime. This finding and intuition are consistent with the evidence in Amore, Bennedsen, and Larsen (2022), discussed in the Introduction: Danish firms with locally-residing CEOs and with CEOs whose children attend the same school as those of employees, have higher employee satisfaction. The Anchor Hocking case from the Introduction is also consistent with this result: Alexander (2017) reports that many Lancaster residents believed that the venture capitalist Newell, who later took over the company, instructed managers not to live in Lancasterbecause they would not adopt painful cost-cutting measures if they were heavily involved in the communityFinally, Proposition @3 establishes that polarizing outside options in favor of managers reduces total welfare, when managers exert less community effort than workers. This form of polarization can capture societal changes that push rich and poor individuals to segregate in distinct neighborhoods, where the rich neighborhoods are more desirable. The logic of this result is that, when B\",\"category\":\"Document\",\"relative_path\":\"Employment and Community - Socioeconomic Cooperation and Its Breakdown.pdf\"},{\"chunk\":\"by 2019, before the pandemic, this share had fallen to less than 70%. The GSS also indicates that the share of Americans with no membership in any non-religious civid association increased from around 35% in the early 1980s to over 45% in 2004while the share of Americans who said that most people can be trusted dropped precipitously from around 40% in 1975 to just above 20% in 2022]3 These weakening civic ties are reflected in how much Americans appear to be willing to make sacrifices for the good of others as measured by blood donations per capita, which have declined from the early 1990s by about one third (Wallace et al.1998] Free et al.2023). Other measures of the health of American communities are also in decline: the fraction of out-of-wedlock births and single-parent households have increased (Kearney2023), \\\\\\\\\\\\\"deaths of despair\\\\\\\\\\\\\" have risen (Case and Deaton2020), and various dimensions of civic-mindedness and trust have declined (Rainie and Perrin 2019). The same period has also witnessed changes in the internal organization and management strategies of firms, with evidence suggesting both a shift toward less worker-friendly management practices (Stansbury and Summers2020] Acemoglu, He, and Maire2023) and more intensive worker monitoring (Gordon[1996)The experiences of several US communities can illustrate these patterns and give us clues about the underlying mechanisms.
