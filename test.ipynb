More work is needed to investigate whether there is a causal relationship between the disappearance of attractive em ployment opportunities for workers and the retrenchment of civic life in local communities, and whether this causal effect works through the mechanisms highlighted by our framework. The evidence presented in, among others, Wilson (1996), Black, McKinnish, and Sanders (2005), and Autor, Dorn, and Hanson (2019) suggests that this is plausible, but the exact causal mech- anisms have yet to be studied empirically. For instance, it is possible that variables found to be correlated with social mobility, education, health, and other socioeconomic outcomes in these literatures may be proxying for labor market rents or how binding the outside options of differ- ent demographic groups are. Our results therefore push for empirical models where the causal effects of these variables are carefully controlled for. They also suggest new empirical tests, for example exploring whether exogenous declines in wages in an areaholding constant other aspects of\",\"relative_path\":\"Employment and Community - Socioeconomic Cooperation and Its Breakdown.pdf\",\"category\":\"Document\"},{\"chunk\":\"However, further increases in M raise total welfare, as this benefits managers and has no effect on workers.Proposition @2 shows that improving outside options shifts the equilibrium employment regime from soft or tough-but-fair to tough (in addition to reducing payoffs within each type of equilibrium). The intuition is that improving outside options reduces community benefits, which in turn makes it more difficult to dissuade managers from adopting the tough regime. This finding and intuition are consistent with the evidence in Amore, Bennedsen, and Larsen (2022), discussed in the Introduction: Danish firms with locally-residing CEOs and with CEOs whose children attend the same school as those of employees, have higher employee satisfaction. The Anchor Hocking case from the Introduction is also consistent with this result: Alexander (2017) reports that many Lancaster residents believed that the venture capitalist Newell, who later took over the company, instructed managers not to live in Lancasterbecause they would not adopt painful cost-cutting measures if they were heavily involved in the communityFinally, Proposition @3 establishes that polarizing outside options in favor of managers reduces total welfare, when managers exert less community effort than workers. This form of polarization can capture societal changes that push rich and poor individuals to segregate in distinct neighborhoods, where the rich neighborhoods are more desirable. The logic of this result is that, when B\",\"category\":\"Document\",\"relative_path\":\"Employment and Community - Socioeconomic Cooperation and Its Breakdown.pdf\"},{\"chunk\":\"by 2019, before the pandemic, this share had fallen to less than 70%.

      "    - The US and China are experiencing a decoupling of their economies, driven by national security interests and the need to diversify growth sources. This decoupling is evident in the decline in bilateral trade, which fell by 11.6 percent in 2023, marking the first decrease since 2019. This drop is attributed to reduced global demand and US export sanctions that restrict US firms from exporting to China ('vietnam-2024-outlook-report-en.pdf').\n",
      "    - The technological aspect of the decoupling is particularly significant. China views technological self-sufficiency as crucial for economic and military superiority. This focus on technology is an essential part of China's strategy to mitigate risks and reduce dependence on other countries ('vietnam-2024-outlook-report-en.pdf').\n",

Vietnam is seeking to diversify its export markets and reduce its reliance on China, which aligns with the US's economic interests ('vietnam-2024-outlook-report-en.pdf').\n",
      "    - In the context of decoupling, Vietnam has seen opportunities for closer economic ties with the US. This relationship is beneficial for both countries as Vietnam looks to expand its export markets and the US recognizes the economic advantages of this partnership ('vietnam-2024-outlook-report-en.pdf').\n",
      "    - Vietnam, along with other countries like Taiwan, Canada, Mexico, India, and South Korea, has increasingly replaced China in the US market. For strategic goods, Vietnam and Taiwan have gained the largest market share in the US over the period from 2017 to 2022 ('vietnam-2024-outlook-report-en.pdf').\n",
